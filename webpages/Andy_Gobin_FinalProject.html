            <h2>Introduction to the Districts:</h2>
            <h3>District 12:</h3>
            <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/d/new-york-city-geographic-district-no-12-ny/" target="_blank"><img src="images/D12Map.JPG" alt="District 12 map" style="width:500px; height: auto;"></a>
            <p>
                District 12 is defined as the East Tremont and Claremont Village areas of the Bronx.
                In 2021, there were an estimated 175,532 people in East Tremont, of which 0.5% identified as Asian, 29.9% identified as Black, 61.3% identified as Hispanic, and 3.6% identified as White. The poverty rate in the East Tremont area is around 35.8% as of 2021. These numbers come from the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/belmont-east-tremont" target="_blank">Furmancenter.org</a>'s data.
                Claremont village has a population of around 40,000 people with 61% Hispanic, 35% Black, and 2% White. 48.6% of the children in Claremont Village live below the federal poverty line. The polulation numbers come from the <a href="https://www.htcsbronx.org/claremont-village#:~:text=The%20neighborhood%20is%20about%2061,American%2C%20and%202%25%20White." target="_blank">Harriet Tubman Charter School</a>'s data and the poverty numbers come from the <a href="https://www.neighborhoodscout.com/ny/bronx/claremont#:~:text=NeighborhoodScout%27s%20research%20shows%20that%20this,than%2093.1%25%20of%20U.S.%20neighborhoods." target="_blank">Neighborhoodscout.com</a>'s data.
            
            <br>
            <br>

                I am from District 12, I went to school in District 12, and that makes me a first hand witness of these numbers.
            </p>

            <h3>District 31:</h3>
            <a href="https://www.niche.com/k12/d/new-york-city-geographic-district-no-31-ny/" target="_blank"><img src="images/D31Map.JPG" alt="District 31 map" style="width:500px; height: auto;"></a>
            <p>
                District 31 encompasses the entirety of Staten Island in which there was an estimated 493,494 people in Staten Island in 2021, of which 11.4% identified as Asian, 8.8% identified as Black, 18.7% identified as Hispanic, and 57.5% identified as white. The poverty rate in Staten Island is 11.5% as of 2021. These numbers come from the <a href="https://furmancenter.org/neighborhoods/view/staten-island" target="_blank">Furmancenter.org</a>'s data.
            </p>
 
            <p>
                <b>Note:</b> Each circle with a grade on them in the image represents a schools rating based on <a href="https://www.niche.com/about/where-niche-grades-come-from/" target="_blank">Niche.com</a>'s own grading scale, which is based on a system of "gathering data and reviews", "rigorous analysis", "user insights", and then "producing grades". Notice how District 31 schools have higher grades than school in District 12. In additon to District 31's schools holding overall higher ratings, District 31 also has more schools than than District 12 with 77 schools in total. While District 12 only has 51 schools. District 12 may have more high schools, but District 31 has more than double the elementary schools.

            <h2>Key information to know:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <p>
                        <b>NYC DOE's definition of Poverty:</b> NYC DOE "Poverty" counts are based on the number of students with families who have qualified for free or reduced price lunch, or are eligible for Human Resources Administration (HRA) benefits.
                            <br><br>    
                        <b>How race data was collected:</b> Enrollment counts are based on the October 31 Audited Register for the 2017-18 to 2019-20 school years. Counts are based on information given during enrollment.
                            <br><br>
                        <b>Method:</b> I used correlation analysis in order to explain the relationship between two variables, being race and poverty. When using correlation analysis you find the coefficient of correlation which is a number between -1 and 1 which tells you whether the relation between the variables is strong, moderate, or weak. On top of that it tells yo if the relationship is a postitive or negative correlation if there is any correlation at all.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <b>Limitations of the data set:</b>
                        <br>
                        <span class="arrow arrow-right" style="position: relative; right:10px"></span>If the school has over 95% poverty it won’t give an exact number of students in poverty it will just say over 95%. Which is why most of the charts about the Bronx will only show a few plot points as it wouldn't let me plot any points where the poverty was over 95%.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <span class="arrow arrow-right" style="position: relative; right:10px"></span>If parents enrolling their children consciously or subconsciously answer the surveys incorrectly that information will stay and affect the data set.

            <p>As there are more students enrolled in the New York City school system there is more poverty. This is shown by both the trend line and the coefficient of correlation. Throughuot the years of 2017 to 2022 on average, 73.8% of enrolled students live in poverty.</p>

            <p>This is where the differences start. The overall population of the Bronx is higher than Staten Island but also the overall rate of poverty within the school system is far greater than the Bronx. On average the Bronx's povery rate based on enrollment through the years 2017 through 2022 is 86%, which is above the NYC average. While Staten Island's povery rate based on enrollment through the years 2017 through 2022 is 59%, which is not just lower than the Bronx it is also lower than the NYC average.</p>

            <p>Now this is where we see that District 12 has lower enrollment than District 31, espcially considering District 31 consists of the whole borough of Staten Island. Looking into the poverty now based on each individual school, we see that District 31 has an average poverty rate of 56.1% when District 12's average poverty rate based on each school is a staggering 91.8%</p>

        <p>On first glance these may look like the same scatter plot and coefficient of correlation, but they are not. What these scatter plots show that race affect poverty especially when look the relation between total Hispanic students and poverty considering the strong postive correlation in both scatter plots.</p>

            <p>Yet again these look like the same scatter plots considering how similar the correlation of coefficient's are and how the trendlines almost follow the same angle, which shows the same rate of poverty.</p>
            <p>The key takeaway from both of these scatter plots is no matter the district if you are a certain race the chance thay you live in poverty maybe higher than other races as shown above.</p>

            <h3>The solution</h3>
            <p>
                Either District 12 is not being given enough money based on their needs or there is a mismangement of funds present.
                <br>
                The fix would be for the DOE to either adjust the formula used to calculate the Fair Student Funding to give enough funding to districts that need it the most, like District 12. Another possible thing the DOE can do is to make sure the fund allocated to school is being spent on things they actually need.
            </p>

            <h3>Further problems</h3>
            <p>
                "The city’s education department budget would drop by nearly $960 million next school year under a more detailed budget proposal released by Mayor Eric Adams on Wednesday, though city officials did not offer specifics about the impact on individual campuses. Two-thirds of that cut, or $652 million, is the result of Adams’ decision to reduce the city’s contribution to the education department. Another $297 million is from a drop in federal funding, which is drying up as pandemic relief programs end."
