        The use of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence, AI, in the classroom has grown over the past year. Sometimes generative AI is a useful tool and other times less. Throughout my high school writing classes, we were repeatedly told about how sophistication is important when writing. During my advanced placement writing courses we learned about the sophistication point in which oftentimes you would be one off of a perfect score because, by College Board’s standards, you lacked sophistication. This sophistication point is defined as “[d]emonstrates sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation.” (College Board). My use of ChatGPT during this assignment will be to give my advanced placement-era writing to see what it would take for it to become sophisticated. Generative AI would be useful for me as it would help show me how to improve my writing, most students would probably just let ChatGPT write their whole paper but as I mentioned in class I would use generative AI like a search engine to supplement my education. I would be able to improve my writing by taking notice of what the generative AI changes in writing and how it changes it, I would then have to change those habits in future writing, To accomplish this task I went back into my archives and found a paper that I wrote that did not receive the sophistication point.

    <p>
        I told ChatGPT to “Make my essay demonstrate the sophistication of thought and/or a complex understanding of the rhetorical situation” and provided my original writing. The original prompt given by Mr. Devin Kelly was “Based on your artwork, write a complex, organized, five (5) paragraph rhetorical analysis essay that explains both the message of your artwork and the rhetorical choices you made in order to convey such a message.” (Kelly). which describes an image that I attached at the end of this assignment along with the original writing, errors included.

    ChatGPT: The exploration of liminal space, a concept pervasive in human experience yet often eluding conscious acknowledgment, unveils a multifaceted contemplation. At its zenith, this reflective inquiry converges with the enigmatic Backrooms, a liminal domain encapsulating an uncanny simulacrum of a commonplace office setting. This essay seeks to unravel the intricacies of liminal space, employing a nuanced comprehension underscored by rhetorical finesse.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        In essence, liminal space is delineated as a transitory juncture between divergent locales or states of being, a construct elucidated by Fandom. Within this framework, the quintessential 4 am school hallway, characterized by its familiarity ensconced within an alien temporal and spatial context, serves as a microcosm of liminality. Such instances beckon the observer to traverse the thresholds of the known and the unfamiliar, unveiling the inherent ambiguity harbored within the mundane.

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        Embarking upon a metacognitive expedition into the provenance of my creative influences, the indelible imprint of H.P. Lovecraft emerges. His literary oeuvre, a paragon of eldritch narratives, bequeaths an intellectual foundation steeped in the nebulous and the unfathomable. Concurrently, the incorporation of two Alternate Reality Games (ARGs) amplifies the layers of complexity, weaving a tapestry of uncertainty through their thematic resonance with the unknown. A parallel narrative unfolds with the inclusion of an indie horror game developer, whose graphical stylings echo the evocative aesthetics of the original PlayStation era, injecting a retro-modern allure into the artistic tapestry.

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        The thematic nucleus of my artistic endeavor orbits around the nebulous trajectory of the future, an ambitious undertaking manifested through the meticulous orchestration of lighting contrast, graininess, and a gradient of color transitioning from luminosity to obscurity. This trinity of visual elements, meticulously harnessed, serves as an allegorical lexicon, articulating the intricacies of existential ambiguity.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        The strategic manipulation of lighting contrast, a hallmark of liminal space photography, emerges as a visual catalyst propelling the narrative forward. The ethereal luminescence of the buildings within the composition, ostensibly bereft of any palpable life, metamorphoses into a poignant tableau emblematic of the uncharted destiny that lies ahead. A rhetorical resonance echoes through this chiaroscuro, beckoning the audience to meditate upon the prospect of architectural vestiges in a state of suspended animation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        Parallel to this, the infusion of graininess, meticulously applied to the reflective surfaces of the water, invokes a metanarrative derived from indie horror game aesthetics. This stylistic flourish not only amplifies the overarching theme of uncertainty but also introduces a perceptual dissonance, akin to the veiled uncertainty that shrouds the buildings and their immediate surroundings. The deliberate introduction of a visual haze acts as a catalyst, prompting contemplation into the spectral future awaiting these architectural sentinels.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        The serendipitous integration of a color gradient, stemming organically from the ground and ascending toward the celestial vault, fortuitously materialized during the incorporation of lighting contrast. This chromatic spectrum, meticulously concentrated upon the buildings, serves as a visual semaphore, deftly guiding the viewer's gaze. The unintentional emergence of this gradient transcends its visual appeal, metamorphosing into a thematic amplifier, magnifying the overarching message of uncertainty embedded within the composition.

        The nomenclature bestowed upon the artwork, "Solidarity in Transition," derives its intellectual gravitas from the contextual depth entrenched within the captured imagery. It memorializes a pivotal epoch in the historical trajectory of Poland, encapsulating the waning days of the Polish People's Republic and the emergent fervor of Solidarity, a trade union catalyzing socio-political transformation. This historical backdrop augments the intellectual resonance of the artwork, accentuating the thematic intricacies of uncertainty and transformation.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        The genesis of my artistic expression emanates from a confluence of idiosyncratic interests, a departure from conventionality that fortuitously synergizes with the liminal narrative. The deliberate incorporation of communism into the visual lexicon elevates the composition, transcending the confines of individual predilections to orchestrate a symphony of visual and thematic complexities.
    </p>

    <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        In conclusion, this essay endeavors to epitomize a sophisticated contemplation of liminality, employing rhetorical finesse to navigate the nuanced landscape of artistic expression. Through a kaleidoscopic exploration of visual elements and historical contextualization, the intellectual depth of the essay strives to parallel the intricacies encapsulated within the liminal space it seeks to elucidate.

        Now comparing the original writing to what was produced here I can most definitely say that ChatGPT did make it more sophisticated. It did help to produce a sophisticated essay, but it would not help improve my writing as I have no clue how I would be able to write like this on the spot. ChatGPT made my writing pretentious, I am not sure how anyone could produce writing like this on demand. The danger of this would be that students are going to give up on improving their writing in favor of letting generative AI write their entire paper. If I wrote something and then gave it to a generative AI to redo it and saw something similar to the response above I would be discouraged from continuing to write. This discouragement is dangerous to students as when tasked with on-demand writing the student would not be able to produce writing that is anything like the generative AI’s or even to replicate some of the changes a generative AI would make to their paper. This might be able to be overcome by giving the generative AI a prompt that takes the paper corrects any errors and makes it sophisticated but not overly sophisticated as it did with my paper, this would be helpful as students would then be able to see the changes they need to make and be able to replicate it in future papers. 
    </p>

    <p>
        Instructors should incorporate this use of generative AI into their courses by teaching students how to give a generative AI their paper to improve it without making it the pretentious mess above. The instructor should let the students make it a habit to let generative AI check over their papers and not let it write the entire paper, if generative AI is used to supplement the paper the generative should be cited at the bottom to let the instructor know so they could grade accordingly. This process would be helpful during high school as it would build the foundations for good writing and hopefully, the students will need the generative AI less to the point where they can produce similar improvements to the AI on their own. I do not use generative AI in my papers, I have only ever used it here and on another assignment in which I had to review a book review done by a generative AI. Generally, I am against the use of generative AI in the classroom as I feel that I can learn more without it as there are many cases of students entirely depending on generative AI. These students who depend on generative AI are not learning nearly as much as those doing the work naturally what do they plan to do if the generative AI is not available to them? At this point, the availability of generative AI is widespread so instead of outright banning the use of it in education instructors should teach the uses of generative AI that would be beneficial to the students.

	Liminal space is something everyone has seen at least once in their life, yet they may not know it by name. One of the most popular liminal spaces is one of a place called the Backrooms which showcases a really familiar office setting that no one recalls ever being in. Liminal space is defined as a “location which is a transition between two other locations, or states of being” (Fandom). A perfect example of this would be the school hallway at 4 am, as it is a familiar location at an unfamiliar time or setting. Looking back at my bibliography of influence you see the writer H.P. Lovecraft who wrote many famous works on the unknown and incomprehensible, you also see two ARGs or alternate reality games which portray themes of the unknown, and you see an indie horror game developer whose art style is similar to the graphics of an original PlayStation. Similarly, the message of my is the uncertainty of the future which I portrayed through lighting contrast, graininess, and the color gradient of light to dark from the ground to the sky.
    </p>
        
    <p>
        The lighting contrast was one of the first things I did when editing this image, as in most liminal space photos, lack of light is a very common style choice. The buildings are the very first you’ll notice as they are much lighter than the surrounding environment. Buildings are a very common sign of people, yet you do not see a single sign of life in the image other than those buildings. This portrays a message of the uncertainty of the future as these buildings seem abandoned. If the buildings are as they seem who is going to maintain them and what is going to happen to them in the future? Those buildings are prone to deteriorate if there is no one to maintain that land, the future of those buildings is unknown, but the surrounding details point to a future of deterioration for those buildings. Who really knows what is to come of this land in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
        The graininess was something that I had wanted to add to the water because for some reason only the land was grainy but the water was clear. The effect I was attempting to imitate was from a majority of indie horror games which there is a grainy filter turned on once whatever the antagonist of the game starts chasing you. So I added graininess to the water, mainly on the reflection of the buildings, in order to really establish the message of uncertainty. The graininess builds on the effect of the color contrast by giving off the message of what is going to happen to those buildings. The graininess also adds a sort of blur effect to the reflection of the buildings which adds to the message of uncertainty, the land and the water will be there but the future of the building and the surrounding environment is blurry.
    </p>

    <p>
        The color gradient of light to dark from the ground to the sky was an unintentional choice made when I added in the lighting contrast. When I was adding in the lighting contrast it the gradient was added as a side effect and it perfectly ties back into that idea. You’ll notice that the buildings are the clearest part of the image, and that choice was intentional, which ties back into the fact that I was attempting to draw attention to the buildings in order to make people wonder about the context behind the image is. That is one thing I always attempt to do whenever I work on a project, I always want try to leave my work up for the interpretation of others and I try to leave as little context as usual to keep the viewer's attention. Going back to the image the gradient was added to draw further attention to the buildings and further establish the message of uncertainty. 
    </p>

    <p>
        The reason behind the name of the artwork comes from the context of the image. Before Poland was the country it is today it was known as Polish People’s Republic and was “the second most-populous communist and Eastern Bloc country in Europe.” (Wikipedia). Towards the end of the Polish People’s Republic there was a party known as Solidarity or the Polish trade union, and they sought capitalism in Poland through the legislative elections which were “the country's first pluralistic election since 1947.”(Wikipedia). These people sought a different type of Solidarity after many years of communism, which really shows the uncertainty of the future. These people had been in a country of communism since 1947 and in 1980 Solidarity, the Polish trade union, was founded and fought for workers’ rights and social change. Though it is most notable for playing a central role in the fall of communism in Poland. So these people had wanted such a big change years after communism was established here and it really shows the uncertainty of the situation.

    <p>
        The artwork I made was based on my interests, which in comparison to some of my classmates may seem very out of place especially considering a lot of people have never even heard of the term ARG. I also wanted the inclusion of communism into the art piece and finding this image was perfect and the perfect idea came to mind instantly. If my art piece did interest you I would recommend you to check out other liminal art pieces or even check out an ARG or two.
