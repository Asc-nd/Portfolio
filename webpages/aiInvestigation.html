            Generative artificial intelligence, referred to as AI, is one of the newer emerging technologies that have taken the world by storm over the past year. AI has become so large that there has been an issue with it being used in schools to write full papers for students. For this paper I was asked to critique a book review done by generative artificial intelligence in which I attached the conversation between me and the AI at the end, I decided to ask the AI to review Albert Camus’ <i>The Stranger</i>. <i>The Stranger</i> is known for its depictions of absurdism and existentialism and is one of the most renowned novels of the 20th century. As someone who has read the novel twice and constantly thinks about some of the ideas brought up, I feel that I would be able to critique a review of the novel accurately. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI review gives some background to the novel including themes, when the book was first published, and comments about Camus’ style. The AI went as far as to describe Camus’ prose as “spare yet evocative” (ChatGPT 2023, line 4). Which I would say is pretty accurate as Camus stylistically chooses to use what feels like minimalistic language throughout the entirety of the novel. The AI also speaks highly of Camus’ descriptive language as the AI claims “[o]ne of the novel's most striking aspects is Camus' vivid portrayal of the Algerian landscape.” (ChatGPT 2023, line 17). I would not say that the description of the Algerian landscape is “[o]ne of the novel's most striking aspects” (ChatGPT 2023, line 17). It is one of the repeating aspects of the novel as it is one of the motifs of the novel, but it is something that I acknowledged and glanced over in my readings. The AI is accurate in saying that there is a symbiosis between the setting and Meursault’s, the protagonists’, issues as we see Meursault make irrational decisions while being in the presence of the sun. One positive about the AI review is that it mentions the spare prose and then mentions one of the moments when it strays away from the spareness for stylistic reasons.
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI describes Meursault and briefly mentions that Meursault’s mother, Maman, dies at the beginning. Then it goes on to state that after Maman’s death there “is a sequence of events that expose the absurdity of existence.” (ChatGPT 2023, lines 7-8). It is more like the death of Maman is what starts the sequence rather than the sequence starting after his mother's death. The AI pays little attention to the death of Maman despite this death setting up the rest of the novel as Meursault is critiqued by society for not grieving his mother’s death and for even putting her in the home in the first place. The death of Maman also frames part two as during his case they mention Meursault’s lack of emotions towards his mother's death, even though part two of the novel is subjectively more “spare” than the first part it is just as important it only gets mentioned in one sentence throughout this entire AI review. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI then decided to dedicate two paragraphs to Camus’ exploration of the concept of the absurd. The AI states “that life is inherently devoid of meaning, and individuals must confront the absurdity of their existence head-on.” (ChatGPT 2023, lines 22-24). This is accurate as well, throughout the novel we see Meursault decide what is or is not important to him. The AI review briefly mentions how Meursault’s relationships are a mirror of him and mentions the characters Marie, Raymond, and Meursault’s defense attorney. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One thing that the AI review is missing is the inclusion of quotes or at least examples from the novel. For example, the AI mentions the Algerian sun making Meursault act irrationally but does not give any examples of it. The same goes for the sequence of events that “expose the absurdity of existence.” (ChatGPT 2023, line 8). The same can also be said for Meursault confronting the absurdity of reality. Quotes or at least examples could help to show the reader what you are talking about in the review. It would be beneficial to the reader to have an example of, let's say, the sun making Meursault act irrationally. Another missing piece of the AI review is any mention of part two of the novel. As mentioned before the AI review has only one sentence that references part two of <i>The Stranger</i>. It kind of feels like the AI only read the first part and decided that was enough to write a review on. 
        </p>

        <p>
            The AI review provided a decent review of what felt like only the first half of Albert Camus’ <i>The Stranger</i>. One shortcoming of the AI is that it may not have the right interpretation of the novel. One possible limitation of the AI is that it is unsure of how to either make quotes or take examples from the novel. Overall the AI review felt like a draft of a review that was done by someone who only read half of the book and did not include quotes yet. Generative artificial intelligence has a long way to go before it is the perfect review machine as of right now it makes the perfect half-done drafts.

            <h2>An Absurdist Masterpiece: A Review of Albert Camus' "The Stranger"</h2>
        </center>

       <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        Albert Camus' "The Stranger" is a seminal work of existentialist literature that continues to captivate readers with its stark portrayal of the human condition. Originally published in 1942, this novel explores themes of absurdity, alienation, and the inherent meaninglessness of life through the lens of its enigmatic protagonist, Meursault. Camus' spare yet evocative prose, coupled with his unflinching examination of the human psyche, makes "The Stranger" a timeless and thought-provoking read.

       <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        The story is narrated by Meursault, a dispassionate and emotionally detached Algerian, who learns of his mother's death at the beginning of the novel. What follows is a sequence of events that expose the absurdity of existence. Meursault's inability to conform to societal norms and express conventional emotions leads him to commit a senseless act of violence, setting in motion a chain of events that will irrevocably alter his life.
       </p>

       <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        Camus masterfully crafts Meursault's character as the quintessential embodiment of existentialism. Meursault's indifference to social expectations and moral conventions serves as a stark critique of a society that demands conformity and purpose in the face of life's inherent meaninglessness. His inability to feign grief or remorse for his actions highlights the absurdity of human existence and the futility of adhering to societal constructs.
       </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        One of the novel's most striking aspects is Camus' vivid portrayal of the Algerian landscape. The scorching sun and the unforgiving heat become metaphors for the existential heat that Meursault feels, intensifying as the story unfolds. Camus' descriptions of the physical environment mirror Meursault's emotional landscape, creating a powerful symbiosis between the setting and the protagonist's inner turmoil.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        "The Stranger" also delves into the philosophical concept of the absurd. Camus posits that life is inherently devoid of meaning, and individuals must confront the absurdity of their existence head-on. Meursault's indifference to societal norms and his apathy towards his own life epitomize this philosophy. His actions, which culminate in his trial and subsequent conviction, emphasize the absurdity of a justice system that attempts to rationalize irrational acts.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        Camus' exploration of absurdity is further accentuated by his portrayal of the other characters in the novel. Meursault's relationships with those around him—his girlfriend, Marie, his neighbor, Raymond, and his defense attorney—serve as mirrors reflecting the absurdity of human interactions and the futile search for meaning in a world that inherently lacks it.
        </p>

        <p style="text-indent: 0%;">
        In conclusion, Albert Camus' "The Stranger" remains a brilliant and enduring work of literature that forces readers to confront the existential questions that lie at the heart of the human experience. Through the detached and unapologetic character of Meursault, Camus challenges us to grapple with the absurdity of life and the meaninglessness of our actions. With its thought-provoking themes, evocative prose, and timeless relevance, "The Stranger" is a must-read for anyone seeking to explore the depths of existentialism and the human condition. It serves as a poignant reminder that in the face of life's absurdity, it is our responsibility to find our own meaning and create our own truths.
