            In today's world, many new forms of technology are coming out almost every day. Some of these technologies have moral flaws that are looked over by those creating them as they feel that the benefit of the technology outweighs the bad and the risk of bad happening.  This case focuses on how the creation of the blockchain came from good intentions, but how people are taking advantage of flaws in the system to profit off the backs of unsuspecting blockchain participants in the case of cryptocurrency.
        </p>

        <p>
            The blockchain is essentially a large set of replicated and synchronized data that is shared worldwide and amongst websites. This means that the same data that you would see in one country on one site would be the same data you would see in another country on a completely different site. The blockchain was created by a group who went by Satoshi Nakamoto in 2008, they were also responsible for developing Bitcoin in the first place. The Satoshi Nakamoto group saw that there was a problem in the previous transaction methods in which holders of Bitcoin would be able to spend one coin twice. Which would cause inflation in the coin and would need to be stopped if they wanted Bitcoin to continue to grow. This is where the blockchain comes in as within the blockchain each transaction is documented, represented by a block, and then linked together by an address. Since all of these transactions link to each other it creates a chain of transactions in which you can go back to the minting of the cryptocurrency. This address is attached to a wallet and is essentially your blockchain identification number, with this number you can see all the transactions, fees, cryptocurrencies received, and cryptocurrencies sent. The one flaw with this system is that it is completely anonymous, there is no way you can trace back an address to the owner of the address. For example, my public address under the Ethereum blockchain is 0x7a2147d6f792a5967a5652ffc5488365cdd4f472 and there would be no other way you would be able to trace that address to me if I had not said it as there is absolutely no identifying information in the address. Now with that information, you can take my address and search for it on any website that has access to the Ethereum blockchain, like Blockchain.com, you will see all the aforementioned information. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Now there is a contradiction as blockchains are very transparent when it comes to transactions but they keep the identity of the owner of the address completely anonymous. This is where the moral issues come in, as the anonymity makes it so you can get away with anything. This includes things like money laundering and making it so that committing fraud is incredibly easy. This raises many moral issues from the perspective of the developers of the cryptocurrency as the only concern about the currency previously was “Is my cryptocurrency going to go up in value?” But now the questions are more like “How long should I wait before I take all of the investor money out of the currency?” The perfect example of this is OneCoin, Ruja Ignatova was the founder of OneCoin and created a large buzz in the crypto community as she made outrageous claims and brought in many investors into OneCoin. “Ignatova allegedly made false statements and representations to individuals in order to solicit investments in OneCoin. She allegedly instructed victims to transmit investment funds to OneCoin accounts in order to purchase OneCoin packages, causing victims to send wire transfers representing these investments.” (FBI, “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives”). Ignatova had no care for the people she was about to defraud billions of dollars from investors worldwide. She was not concerned about whether this was their investor's life savings, whether this was their investor's college funds, or even whether this was their investor's way out of debt. As long as there was money she wanted it and the methods of convincing Ignatova used worked as “OneCoin is believed to have defrauded victims out of more than $4 billion.” (FBI, “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives”). Now Ignatova’s charges consist of  “Conspiracy to Commit Wire Fraud; Wire Fraud; Conspiracy to Commit Money Laundering; Conspiracy to Commit Securities Fraud; and Securities Fraud.” (FBI, “Ten Most Wanted Fugitives”) that is if she is caught. The main moral issue brought up is whether the developer should be genuine in their claims and actually provide a cryptocurrency that is beneficial to them and their investors or should they take all the earnings for themselves. It is also unethical as the developers have become wealthy at the cost of people who trusted them. Who knows how the investment money was made and what circumstances the investors may have been under? Now the guilt is in the developer's hands.

        <p>
            The two main things that the example showcases are how easy it is to commit fraud and how easy it is to get away with crimes because of the anonymity factor she was easily able to launder the money out to different accounts. Now looking at cryptocurrencies and the current state of the blockchain with this gained understanding we see that based on the cost-benefit analysis is that this will cost you more than it benefits in the odd chance that you do invest in a cryptocurrency such as OneCoin, or FTX which was a cryptocurrency exchange and crypto hedge fund, you will most likely never see that money again as only the big cases of fraud are looked. Then again if your money does not get taken who is to say that the price of the currency will lead to a positive investment? When using the risk-benefit analysis we’ll see the same thing who is to say that the currency will rise in value and if the currency does rise in value who is to say the developers will not take all the money out and run? Looking at Ferré’s Ethics, Assessment, and Technology the blockchain in the case of cryptocurrencies would be classified as a non-moral good as it would fit under wealth. Furthermore, assuming you are wealthy enough to invest in cryptocurrencies you are already somewhat wealthy we can assume that wealth as a non-moral good is already satisfied, so this further persecution of wealth is out of greed as wealth is extrinsic and has no real value only the pursuer gives it. 
        </p>

        <p>
            One possible solution to the anonymity issue is for the blockchain to mandate that developers have to claim their addresses before being able to mint and sell currency. So in the next instance of fraud, anyone with access to the blockchain would be able to go to the developer's address and follow the chain of transactions up to where the currency was taken out for non-cryptocurrency. This would be to prove the case of fraud as if the developer’s name is attached to the first account, where the currency was minted, you could follow it from wallet to wallet which would make giving developers a legal repercussion a whole lot easier. Another solution would be for governments to make laws around rug pulls as developers can claim that they withdrew the money to continue to work on the currency to dodge the charge of fraud. The government should make it so that withdrawing investor funds to continue the development of the cryptocurrency while little to no real progress has been made should still be considered fraud. Now if these solutions were to be implemented the developers would think twice before committing fraud as they would no longer be able to abuse the system.

        <p>
            In the end, blockchains in the case of cryptocurrency are morally dubious as they require the moral integrity of developers. While the intentions of blockchain technology were good they are not always used in the way intended, it puts a lot of power in the hands of people who may not have the right intentions which puts the morality of the blockchain itself in question as if now people know blockchains as the thing a ton of people lost their money in that will be it is main image. Furthermore, participants of the blockchain should think more when it comes to cryptocurrencies as it seems that they throw money at anything that looks like it will do well. Is it worth risking all that for the non-moral good of being wealthy? No not all as there are far better and more morally positive ways of making money.
