    <p>It’s gone, it’s all gone</p>
    <p>There is not a single way to restore it to it’s former glory</p>
    <p>They have failed to take it over and now it is</p>
    <p>All gone</p>
    <p>The Soviet Union has fallen</p>
    <p>The red star is no longer present in Russia</p>

    <br>

    <p> Fuck Gorbachev and his failed attempt at perestroika</p>
    <p>fuck khrushchev for destalinization and making mao leave us</p>
    <p>ending one of the greatest collaborations of all time</p>
    <p>fuck george hw bush and his capitalist america</p>
    <p>fuck adam smith for fostering the initial ideas of capitalism</p>
    <p>fuck the august coup not for trying - but for failing</p>
    <p>fuck everyone involved in the downfall of the Soviet Uniot</p> 
    <p>all I hope to see is the yellow hammer and sickle on a red flag once again</p>
    <p>if only Stalin could return</p>
